// Description: implement GCD.

/*

The greatest common divisor of two integers is 
the largest number that divides them both evenly. 
For example, gcd(12, 18) = 6, gcd(âˆ’4, 14) = 2. 
The most efficient way to compute gcd is with the Euclidean algorithm. 
Write a program with a function to compute gcd for two integers.
